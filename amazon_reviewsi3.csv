This is the best you'll get in this price range Thats it!,,"If you would be building pc just for gaming and slight editing or coding here and there this is perfect and the cost is really low considering what performance it gives, this CPU is by no means a low end CPU dont go gentle with that price the intel 12100f can easily handle GPUs upto gtx3060 or rx6800. Just go for it and say no to ryzen in this price for gaming."
Awesome,,"This is one of the best cpu in budget if you only looking for gaming.
For productivity it not worth buying then you should go for i5 12400f
But for gaming and light cpu workload it work like butter smooth.
I have teated some games in it , you can check it on my YT channel R tech studio."
Best in price when even compared to i5 10400f,,Got this on sale for 7.26k.. Really enjoyed with processor. Heatsink fan provided looks good but sounds badly at peak usage. Replaced it with air cooler
Good,,Performance is good
Used or Unboxed product received,,"Product is good but by looking at packaging anyone can judge that it is used. While checking warranty found that out of 3 year warranty, 6 months is already passed."
cpu with broken fan,,Cpu stock cooler fan got broken with 1 blade in box was creating noise and virbration in cpu but processor was working fine so thought to replace but if replace it i dont know what i am gonna get with broken cpu chip so i replaced stock cooler with deepcool air cooler now it's working fine please don't buy critical pc parts from Amazon you may end up getting with broken parts worst packing
Good Cpu but awful Delivery,,"The Processor is Good & Works Fine. But The Delivery was awful, one of the blades of the fan was broken. As i already had another dedicated cpu cooler, i didn't raise a return. I expected Better from Appario. Apart From this the Processor itself works fine."
Perfeito,,"Muito bom, super recomendo"
Funciona muy bien,,Jala muy bien el procesador
Bueno,,"Muy fluido, con el entorno adecuado. Excelente relación precio prestaciones."
good cpu,,all good works as should happy with purchase
Parfait,,Fait bien le travail pourquoi il a été programmé
