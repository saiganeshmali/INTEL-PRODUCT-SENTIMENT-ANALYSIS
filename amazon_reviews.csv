Excellent Value,,This is a great processor that can handle just about any task imaginable. Just did a computer build and used this processor. And I have nothing bad to say about it. Would definitely use again on future builds.
Amazing quad-core processor for the price!,,"This CPU is incredibly fast and is great for browsing the web and YouTube, completing office tasks or schoolwork, and even light to medium gaming. It only has 4 cores but they are so fast that it can compete with other processors like the 5600G. The integrated graphics aren't amazing but they get the job done and have allowed me to run light games like Roblox and Civ VI while I save for a graphics card. The stock cooler is not amazing at cooling but the i3 12100 doesn't take much power so while any new cooler would probably be an improvement, this one has been doing just fine. For anyone building a PC on a budget, I can easily say this is a great CPU. It won't run all the latest games at max settings but since it can be found for so cheap, it makes for a very cost effective processor."
Great for what it is designed for,,"it's an i3, so don't expect i9 performance. With that said, I am using it in a custom built NAS running Ubuntu, and it seems to run great. It comes with a CPU cooler that works just fine for my purpose. I am in a tight build in a small case with 4 HDDs, and temp under large file transfer loads are ~34 degrees."
Fast shipping,,"Great product, It's really worth the price."
This is the PERFECT processor/best value for basic productive work!,,"How many of you just need a fast processor for standard home/office work? Buy this and call it a day.

If you need something to handle Microsoft Office, any browser (your internet connection matters more), and basic applications, the 12100 is all you need. Loading time is very good. You really don't need amazing graphics to perform any of these tasks. I'm using integrated video and it suits me just fine. My other computer uses the APU on an AMD 5600G and I've never had issues. I paired this CPU with a barebones Gigabyte motherboard (cheapest I could find) and 8GB of DDR4 memory and it rivals my AMD setup for plain tasks.

Don't feel like you need an i5, i7, or even the i3 12400 if you just need an everyday computer for watching videos, doing online banking, or crunching out work material (unless you are editing heavy media). This i3-12100 is the equivalent of a quad core processor from years back. If you are working on virtual machines, doing strong programming, have a million windows open, need to use Adobe Creative Suite to quickly produce and export content, then you may want to consider moving up to a stronger processor. Even so, this one is still pretty good - it will just take longer to complete some things.

I'm overall very happy with this processor and I think most households who have similar requirements will be satisfied. The 12400 did get to $160 at some point so that could be something to look at to future proof a machine since it has six cores (not that I need them right now)."
A-Ok,,No complaints. New sealed box.
Surprisingly good for an i3,,I bought this because my i9-12900k was giving me problems. It was more for troubleshooting. The i3-12100 actually works better than my problematic i9-12900k that had lagging and stuttering issues that made it nearly impossible to work with Microsoft Word or Excel. I never thought I'd see the day that an i3 would outperform an i7 or i9 but this little budget CPU works better than them.
Works great,,I never had any issues with Intel CPUs. This one works great with my 3060 12 GB GPU.
Met my expectations,,It's a good processor for a server but I think it should be cheaper.
Does not have Iris Xe,,"I have this installed into an Asrock motherboard. It works great. I was a little misinformed about the built in graphics and thought when I bought it was I was getting Iris Xe, but it's something called UHD. The product description clearly says UHD, so my bad really. Most of the other Intel 12th gen chips with graphics processing have Iris Xe which has many more graphics processing units. For sure the UHD is fine for many things including streaming video. Not sure about 3D gaming, though. Had I know it was UHD and not Iris, I might have saved $30 or so and bought the version without the graphics. On the other hand, I liked the idea of onboard graphics as a backup or alternative. In either case, this i3 runs like a champ compared to the quad core phenom ii based system it's replacing.
I'm not sure it's relevant here but I think I should mention that my Asrock board can't make use of the on board UHD graphics when you set BIOS to legacy mode. You need to use the UEFI mode in order to use the on board graphics. Not sure if that's typical of other boards or board brands. With my Asrock board, you need a discrete graphics card to use the legacy bios mode to boot from an old non-UEFI installation of windows. If that doesn't make sense to you, don't worry about it."
"Excelente procesador, económico y rapido",,"Compré estos procesadores y pude ensamblar la computadora de mi hijo con 16GB ram y puede jugar al fornite, la tarjeta de video que usé es de 6GB, recomiendo ampliamente el procesador por el precio y lo rápido que es"
Ok,,Ok
It's amazing how far i3s have come!,,"Compared to the i3 of just a few generations ago, it's amazing how far these mid-entry-level CPUs have come.

I upgraded my Plex server to a new motherboard and this i3-12100 and performance is excellent.

Included CPU cooler isn't great but it's good enough."
The Brave Little CPU That Could.,,"I'm very impressed with this CPU. If I had the money I would get the I5-12600 Non-K for video work because of the extra cores but the I3-12100 is freaking amazing. This is the most powerful CPU I have ever used. It can do the video editing I need done for now until I get better. It uses hardly any power, stays cool and is capable of much more than I need for now. I had never been able to do video editing before because the computer would lock up regardless of how fast the HDD was or how much RAM I had."
Great power on a budget,,I've built 3 computers for clients on a budget using this CPU. It's power per dollar is great and it's on board graphics are good enough to run most games okay if you are on a really tight budget.
Works very well even with the provided heatsink and fan.,,it works well in my Linux system. I photo edit using gimp.
Best CPU for the money,,"Great little CPU. I just wanted an entertainment server so I built a quick and dirty $500 computer, but I might actually use this for my video editing and gaming machine instead. Immediately ran benchmarks and was pleasantly surprised. This thing can game and it can be a workhorse. It comes with a fan that's just fine but I had already purchased a separate fan/cooler before realizing this came with one, so I'm using that instead. This is one of those no-brainer items where you're guaranteed quality and performance at a very low price. I wish all items were as good."
Excellent Budget Processor,,"At 4 cores and 8 threads, this processor is equivalent to the top tier i7 processors of just a few years ago. Mine is paired with 16 GB of RAM and an RX 6600, and it handles everything I do (1080 gaming) very comfortably.

The heat sink that is included is very minimalist, but it does the job. Idle temperature is about 40C and the processor peaks at about 65C under load. That being said, the fan is very audible at max speed (3,000 RPM) to maintain that stable temperature under load. One might be wise to consider a different heat sink on a gaming computer. Almost any air-cooled device would be sufficient. Liquid cooling would be overkill.
Otherwise, it will handle everyday home office tasks with little effort."
Affordable intel cpu with built in graphics,,Works great in MSI mobo
Excelente,,Buenas temperaturas con el disipador de fabrica y buen rendimiento al jugar y trabajar
