Amazing quad-core processor for the price!,"This CPU is incredibly fast and is great for browsing the web and YouTube, completing office tasks or schoolwork, and even light to medium gaming. It only has 4 cores but they are so fast that it can compete with other processors like the 5600G. The integrated graphics aren't amazing but they get the job done and have allowed me to run light games like Roblox and Civ VI while I save for a graphics card. The stock cooler is not amazing at cooling but the i3 12100 doesn't take much power so while any new cooler would probably be an improvement, this one has been doing just fine. For anyone building a PC on a budget, I can easily say this is a great CPU. It won't run all the latest games at max settings but since it can be found for so cheap, it makes for a very cost effective processor.",positive,Amazing quad-core processor for the price!,"This CPU is incredibly fast and is great for browsing the web and YouTube, completing office tasks or schoolwork, and even light to medium gaming.

This is the PERFECT processor/best value for basic productive work!,"How many of you just need a fast processor for standard home/office work? Buy this and call it a day.

If you need something to handle Microsoft Office, any browser (your internet connection matters more), and basic applications, the 12100 is all you need. Loading time is very good. You really don't need amazing graphics to perform any of these tasks. I'm using integrated video and it suits me just fine. My other computer uses the APU on an AMD 5600G and I've never had issues. I paired this CPU with a barebones Gigabyte motherboard (cheapest I could find) and 8GB of DDR4 memory and it rivals my AMD setup for plain tasks.

Don't feel like you need an i5, i7, or even the i3 12400 if you just need an everyday computer for watching videos, doing online banking, or crunching out work material (unless you are editing heavy media). This i3-12100 is the equivalent of a quad core processor from years back. If you are working on virtual machines, doing strong programming, have a million windows open, need to use Adobe Creative Suite to quickly produce and export content, then you may want to consider moving up to a stronger processor. Even so, this one is still pretty good - it will just take longer to complete some things.

I'm overall very happy with this processor and I think most households who have similar requirements will be satisfied. The 12400 did get to $160 at some point so that could be something to look at to future proof a machine since it has six cores (not that I need them right now).",positive,This is the PERFECT processor/best value for basic productive work!,"How many of you just need a fast processor for standard home/office work?

Does not have Iris Xe,"I have this installed into an Asrock motherboard. It works great. I was a little misinformed about the built in graphics and thought when I bought it was I was getting Iris Xe, but it's something called UHD. The product description clearly says UHD, so my bad really. Most of the other Intel 12th gen chips with graphics processing have Iris Xe which has many more graphics processing units. For sure the UHD is fine for many things including streaming video. Not sure about 3D gaming, though. Had I know it was UHD and not Iris, I might have saved $30 or so and bought the version without the graphics. On the other hand, I liked the idea of onboard graphics as a backup or alternative. In either case, this i3 runs like a champ compared to the quad core phenom ii based system it's replacing.
I'm not sure it's relevant here but I think I should mention that my Asrock board can't make use of the on board UHD graphics when you set BIOS to legacy mode. You need to use the UEFI mode in order to use the on board graphics. Not sure if that's typical of other boards or board brands. With my Asrock board, you need a discrete graphics card to use the legacy bios mode to boot from an old non-UEFI installation of windows. If that doesn't make sense to you, don't worry about it.",positive,Does not have Iris Xe,"I have this installed into an Asrock motherboard. It works great.

Excellent Budget Processor,"At 4 cores and 8 threads, this processor is equivalent to the top tier i7 processors of just a few years ago. Mine is paired with 16 GB of RAM and an RX 6600, and it handles everything I do (1080 gaming) very comfortably.

The heat sink that is included is very minimalist, but it does the job. Idle temperature is about 40C and the processor peaks at about 65C under load. That being said, the fan is very audible at max speed (3,000 RPM) to maintain that stable temperature under load. One might be wise to consider a different heat sink on a gaming computer.

Great CPU,"I'm using the stock Intel cooler that came with my 12700 and the highest I hit in games is about 79c, most of the time is stays in the low 70s. Idle temps stay in the 30s. That's with the cpu wattage unlocked and raising the pl1 and pl2 settings a bit in the bios and a single intake and single exhaust fan in a mid size case. I learned a long time ago that ambient room temp and fan curves are very important. You want to exhaust as much hot air as you can out of the case as fast as possible. You can mount a skyscraper to your CPU and have 12 case fans, if your room temp is high and you don't set proper fan curves, you'll still run hot. I don't care about cinebench or other benchmarks, most games people play and apps people use on a daily basis will never stress the CPU anywhere near what a benchmark will. If you do a lot of heavy video editing and conversion work and raise your wattage limits way up then yes go for a higher end cooling solution .

Edit: I've since installed an Intel RH1 cooler (the one that comes with the i9) on this chip and it dropped my temps by an average of about 8c. I know I can buy a third party cooler but I don't want a huge cpu cooler in my case and I don't want to play with brackets that may not fit 100% correctly. You can find new RH1 coolers on ebay for pretty cheap.",positive,Great CPU,"I'm using the stock Intel cooler that came with my 12700 and the highest I hit in games is about 79c, most of the time is stays in the low 70s.

VMWare ESXi and E-Cores,"As a desktop processor for Windows, the CPU is great. My use case is as a consumer-grade ESXi server (specifically the latest version, 8). As I feared, ESXi cannot be installed with the stupid E-cores. So, one must disable them in BIOS and all is good. So essentially it's used as an eight P-core processor only.

ESXi is designed for server-grade hardware, which doesn't have the silly E-cores. Perhaps one day VMWare will be able to at least detect E-cores processors and not use them (or treat them differently).

"Great Budget CPU, Not Overclockable - Comes with Cooler","DISCLAIMER: This review covers 3 main items (CPU, MOBO, RAM). Links to the other parts are included (all available at Amazon for good prices). You'll read this review on each of the other parts as well.

WHY DID I BUY IT?
I recently built and absolute beast of a computer and kept my older one as a backup. Unfortunately, it decided to take a dive this past week with the motherboard failing catastropically. Given that it was 10 years old, I decided to replace the ""brains"" with something a little more modern, but not overkill. Because I had spent a LOT of money on a computer recently, I was trying to keep the repair under about $400 and here's what I did...

The BRAINS...
Intel i3-10100 Processor ($100): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086MMRW87
MSI Mag B460 Motherboard ($110): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GXVP1DM
TeamGroup 16GB DDR4 ($60): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WNQVBZ6
*** These are the main parts that MUST be compatible.. and they are ***

I was worried about my hard drive, so I went ahead and splurged on a TeamGroup 1TB SSD ($75 -- www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PX2KKHM) bringing my total to just under $400. I could have kept my old Seagate 500gb 5400 RPM drive but I had a little extra to spend and that greatly sped up boot and wait times.

For what it's worth, I also kept my existing Antec Power Supply (550W) that was replaced about a year ago, my case, and my now very old graphics card (R9 380 - 4gb). I already had a good monitor, mouse, and keyboard so those carried over as well.

So how did it go together? Pretty seamlessly with just 2 little hiccups.

HICCUP #1
RAM: I did not realize the motherboard I purchased has a standard RAM speed of 2666. It can get up to a max of 2933. So the RAM I purchased (3200 speed, CL 16) is overkill and I could have saved another $20 or so. But, I didn't... and it's my first build with TeamGroup RAM and I'm happy with it.

HICCUP #2
LAN/AUDIO: Once I got everything installed, the LAN would not connect to my network (wired, ethernet connection). A little troubleshooting found out YOU MUST TO UPGRADE THE LAN DRIVER for it to work. This means having another computer with internet and a flash drive. Likewise, I went ahead and updated the Audio driver and the sound was much crisper. So... take a moment and download all of the drivers in advance from the MSI website.

FIRST POWER ON: The computer started up, then turned off immediately. It then restarted on it's own and said the motherboard had detected changes so I needed to configure the BIOS. Entering BIOS found that everything was recognized. So I changed the first boot device to USB flash drive and plugged in my Windows 10 install flash drive and restarted.

Bottom Line: The Intel i3-10100 is a great little chip (not overclockable). The MSI 460 Torpedo is a decent motherboard (just update the LAN and Audio drivers) that boots quickly. In fact, it boots so quickly, I don't even see the POST screen. From cold to Windows is easily under 30 seconds.

The RAM is stable at 2666 and fast enough that I probably won't even push the 2933 setting. The SSD is very fast (functionally almost as fast as the M2 drive I have in my beast at a savings of $20-25). Even with the aging R9 graphics card, I'm easily hitting 60 FPS on modern titles at 1080 in medium to high settings. Sometime next year when graphics card prices drop to a reasonable level, I'll update that and have a second gaming rig ready.

Overall, I'm very happy with this setup.",positive,"Great Budget CPU, Not Overclockable - Comes with Cooler","DISCLAIMER: This review covers 3 main items (CPU, MOBO, RAM).

Excelente procesador para gaming,"Yo tengo pc gaming, vengo de un procesador feo Pentium 4600, que corria los juegos, pero hasta ahi, es todo lo que hacia, no podia hacer nada mas que jugar y ya, no podria hacer streaming, no podia entrar a discord para platicar o estar en comunicacion, nada, tenia que hacer una cosa a la vez, me compre este procesador.. y literal, el inicio cambio de 25 segundos a 6.5 segundos (siiii, es mucha diferencia) y ahora puedo hacer streaming y estar en discord mientras juego sin problemas ni nada, super potente para ser un i3 y corre los juegos en 60fps sin problemas a full hd (tengo una nvidia 1050ti)",positive,Excelente procesador para gaming,"Yo tengo pc gaming, vengo de un procesador feo Pentium 4600, que corria los juegos, pero hasta ahi, es todo lo que hacia, no podia hacer nada mas que jugar y ya, no podria hacer streaming, no podia entrar a discord para platicar o estar en comunicacion, nada, tenia que hacer una cosa a la vez, me compre este procesador.. y literal, el inicio cambio de 25 segundos a 6.5 segundos (siiii, es mucha diferencia) y ahora puedo hacer streaming y estar en discord mientras juego sin problemas ni nada, super potente para ser un i3 y corre los juegos en 60fps sin problemas a full hd (tengo una nvidia 1050ti)",excelente procesador para gaming,yo tengo pc gaming vengo de un procesador feo pentium 4600 que corria los juegos pero hasta ahi es todo lo que hacia no podia hacer nada mas que jugar y ya no podria hacer streaming no podia entrar a discord para platicar o estar en comunicacion nada tenia que hacer una cosa a la vez me compre este procesador y literal el inicio cambio de 25 segundos a 65 segundos siiii es mucha diferencia y ahora puedo hacer streaming y estar en discord mientras juego sin problemas ni nada super potente para ser un i3 y corre los juegos en 60fps sin problemas a full hd tengo una nvidia 1050ti
"Great Budget CPU, Not Overclockable - Comes with Cooler","DISCLAIMER: This review covers 3 main items (CPU, MOBO, RAM). Links to the other parts are included (all available at Amazon for good prices). You'll read this review on each of the other parts as well.

WHY DID I BUY IT?
I recently built and absolute beast of a computer and kept my older one as a backup. Unfortunately, it decided to take a dive this past week with the motherboard failing catastropically. Given that it was 10 years old, I decided to replace the ""brains"" with something a little more modern, but not overkill. Because I had spent a LOT of money on a computer recently, I was trying to keep the repair under about $400 and here's what I did...

The BRAINS...
Intel i3-10100 Processor ($100): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086MMRW87
MSI Mag B460 Motherboard ($110): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GXVP1DM
TeamGroup 16GB DDR4 ($60): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WNQVBZ6
*** These are the main parts that MUST be compatible.. and they are ***

I was worried about my hard drive, so I went ahead and splurged on a TeamGroup 1TB SSD ($75 -- www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PX2KKHM) bringing my total to just under $400. I could have kept my old Seagate 500gb 5400 RPM drive but I had a little extra to spend and that greatly sped up boot and wait times.

For what it's worth, I also kept my existing Antec Power Supply (550W) that was replaced about a year ago, my case, and my now very old graphics card (R9 380 - 4gb). I already had a good monitor, mouse, and keyboard so those carried over as well.

So how did it go together? Pretty seamlessly with just 2 little hiccups.

HICCUP #1
RAM: I did not realize the motherboard I purchased has a standard RAM speed of 2666. It can get up to a max of 2933. So the RAM I purchased (3200 speed, CL 16) is overkill and I could have saved another $20 or so. But, I didn't... and it's my first build with TeamGroup RAM and I'm happy with it.

HICCUP #2
LAN/AUDIO: Once I got everything installed, the LAN would not connect to my network (wired, ethernet connection). A little troubleshooting found out YOU MUST TO UPGRADE THE LAN DRIVER for it to work. This means having another computer with internet and a flash drive. Likewise, I went ahead and updated the Audio driver and the sound was much crisper. So... take a moment and download all of the drivers in advance from the MSI website.

FIRST POWER ON: The computer started up, then turned off immediately. It then restarted on it's own and said the motherboard had detected changes so I needed to configure the BIOS. Entering BIOS found that everything was recognized. So I changed the first boot device to USB flash drive and plugged in my Windows 10 install flash drive and restarted.

Bottom Line: The Intel i3-10100 is a great little chip (not overclockable). The MSI 460 Torpedo is a decent motherboard (just update the LAN and Audio drivers) that boots quickly. In fact, it boots so quickly, I don't even see the POST screen. From cold to Windows is easily under 30 seconds.

The RAM is stable at 2666 and fast enough that I probably won't even push the 2933 setting. The SSD is very fast (functionally almost as fast as the M2 drive I have in my beast at a savings of $20-25). Even with the aging R9 graphics card, I'm easily hitting 60 FPS on modern titles at 1080 in medium to high settings. Sometime next year when graphics card prices drop to a reasonable level, I'll update that and have a second gaming rig ready.

Overall, I'm very happy with this setup.",positive,"Great Budget CPU, Not Overclockable - Comes with Cooler","DISCLAIMER: This review covers 3 main items (CPU, MOBO, RAM).

Overkill for me and Most.,"This started a new PC build for me when it was on sale for $320. I haven't built a PC since 2007, so it has changed a bit since then. This thing runs hot at full load. Watch gamers nexus on YouTube. It will pull a solid 250+ watts running cinebench. I'm using an Arctic Freezer 2 420mm with a thermal grizzly contact frame and kryonaut, and it will load up to 80 degrees almost instantly without throttling but drop immediately to 25-30 degrees when the load stops. This is with ambient at 22 degrees.

This thing is brutally fast, though, and in reality, outside of load testing it, I have rarely seen it go over 30% usage. The more recent i5 and i7 processors can more or less be equal in most use cases. i5 13/14600, i7 13/14700.

This processor is still top-tier and will be for a few years to come. 12th gen i-series processors were a game-changer, the 13th-gen improved on them a bit with more e-cores, and the 14th-gen is looking like a stop-gap to the next big thing.
