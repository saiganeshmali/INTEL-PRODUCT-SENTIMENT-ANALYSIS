Title,Rating,Description
Excellent Value,,This is a great processor that can handle just about any task imaginable. Just did a computer build and used this processor. And I have nothing bad to say about it. Would definitely use again on future builds.
Amazing quad-core processor for the price!,,"This CPU is incredibly fast and is great for browsing the web and YouTube, completing office tasks or schoolwork, and even light to medium gaming. It only has 4 cores but they are so fast that it can compete with other processors like the 5600G. The integrated graphics aren't amazing but they get the job done and have allowed me to run light games like Roblox and Civ VI while I save for a graphics card. The stock cooler is not amazing at cooling but the i3 12100 doesn't take much power so while any new cooler would probably be an improvement, this one has been doing just fine. For anyone building a PC on a budget, I can easily say this is a great CPU. It won't run all the latest games at max settings but since it can be found for so cheap, it makes for a very cost effective processor."
Great for what it is designed for,,"it's an i3, so don't expect i9 performance. With that said, I am using it in a custom built NAS running Ubuntu, and it seems to run great. It comes with a CPU cooler that works just fine for my purpose. I am in a tight build in a small case with 4 HDDs, and temp under large file transfer loads are ~34 degrees."
Fast shipping,,"Great product, It's really worth the price."
This is the PERFECT processor/best value for basic productive work!,,"How many of you just need a fast processor for standard home/office work? Buy this and call it a day.

If you need something to handle Microsoft Office, any browser (your internet connection matters more), and basic applications, the 12100 is all you need. Loading time is very good. You really don't need amazing graphics to perform any of these tasks. I'm using integrated video and it suits me just fine. My other computer uses the APU on an AMD 5600G and I've never had issues. I paired this CPU with a barebones Gigabyte motherboard (cheapest I could find) and 8GB of DDR4 memory and it rivals my AMD setup for plain tasks.

Don't feel like you need an i5, i7, or even the i3 12400 if you just need an everyday computer for watching videos, doing online banking, or crunching out work material (unless you are editing heavy media). This i3-12100 is the equivalent of a quad core processor from years back. If you are working on virtual machines, doing strong programming, have a million windows open, need to use Adobe Creative Suite to quickly produce and export content, then you may want to consider moving up to a stronger processor. Even so, this one is still pretty good - it will just take longer to complete some things.

I'm overall very happy with this processor and I think most households who have similar requirements will be satisfied. The 12400 did get to $160 at some point so that could be something to look at to future proof a machine since it has six cores (not that I need them right now)."
A-Ok,,No complaints. New sealed box.
Surprisingly good for an i3,,I bought this because my i9-12900k was giving me problems. It was more for troubleshooting. The i3-12100 actually works better than my problematic i9-12900k that had lagging and stuttering issues that made it nearly impossible to work with Microsoft Word or Excel. I never thought I'd see the day that an i3 would outperform an i7 or i9 but this little budget CPU works better than them.
Works great,,I never had any issues with Intel CPUs. This one works great with my 3060 12 GB GPU.
Met my expectations,,It's a good processor for a server but I think it should be cheaper.
Does not have Iris Xe,,"I have this installed into an Asrock motherboard. It works great. I was a little misinformed about the built in graphics and thought when I bought it was I was getting Iris Xe, but it's something called UHD. The product description clearly says UHD, so my bad really. Most of the other Intel 12th gen chips with graphics processing have Iris Xe which has many more graphics processing units. For sure the UHD is fine for many things including streaming video. Not sure about 3D gaming, though. Had I know it was UHD and not Iris, I might have saved $30 or so and bought the version without the graphics. On the other hand, I liked the idea of onboard graphics as a backup or alternative. In either case, this i3 runs like a champ compared to the quad core phenom ii based system it's replacing.
I'm not sure it's relevant here but I think I should mention that my Asrock board can't make use of the on board UHD graphics when you set BIOS to legacy mode. You need to use the UEFI mode in order to use the on board graphics. Not sure if that's typical of other boards or board brands. With my Asrock board, you need a discrete graphics card to use the legacy bios mode to boot from an old non-UEFI installation of windows. If that doesn't make sense to you, don't worry about it."
"Excelente procesador, económico y rapido",,"Compré estos procesadores y pude ensamblar la computadora de mi hijo con 16GB ram y puede jugar al fornite, la tarjeta de video que usé es de 6GB, recomiendo ampliamente el procesador por el precio y lo rápido que es"
Ok,,Ok
It's amazing how far i3s have come!,,"Compared to the i3 of just a few generations ago, it's amazing how far these mid-entry-level CPUs have come.

I upgraded my Plex server to a new motherboard and this i3-12100 and performance is excellent.

Included CPU cooler isn't great but it's good enough."
The Brave Little CPU That Could.,,"I'm very impressed with this CPU. If I had the money I would get the I5-12600 Non-K for video work because of the extra cores but the I3-12100 is freaking amazing. This is the most powerful CPU I have ever used. It can do the video editing I need done for now until I get better. It uses hardly any power, stays cool and is capable of much more than I need for now. I had never been able to do video editing before because the computer would lock up regardless of how fast the HDD was or how much RAM I had."
Great power on a budget,,I've built 3 computers for clients on a budget using this CPU. It's power per dollar is great and it's on board graphics are good enough to run most games okay if you are on a really tight budget.
Works very well even with the provided heatsink and fan.,,it works well in my Linux system. I photo edit using gimp.
Best CPU for the money,,"Great little CPU. I just wanted an entertainment server so I built a quick and dirty $500 computer, but I might actually use this for my video editing and gaming machine instead. Immediately ran benchmarks and was pleasantly surprised. This thing can game and it can be a workhorse. It comes with a fan that's just fine but I had already purchased a separate fan/cooler before realizing this came with one, so I'm using that instead. This is one of those no-brainer items where you're guaranteed quality and performance at a very low price. I wish all items were as good."
Excellent Budget Processor,,"At 4 cores and 8 threads, this processor is equivalent to the top tier i7 processors of just a few years ago. Mine is paired with 16 GB of RAM and an RX 6600, and it handles everything I do (1080 gaming) very comfortably.

The heat sink that is included is very minimalist, but it does the job. Idle temperature is about 40C and the processor peaks at about 65C under load. That being said, the fan is very audible at max speed (3,000 RPM) to maintain that stable temperature under load. One might be wise to consider a different heat sink on a gaming computer. Almost any air-cooled device would be sufficient. Liquid cooling would be overkill.
Otherwise, it will handle everyday home office tasks with little effort."
Affordable intel cpu with built in graphics,,Works great in MSI mobo
Excelente,,Buenas temperaturas con el disipador de fabrica y buen rendimiento al jugar y trabajar
"The True ""Sweet Spot"" in 12th Gen Processors!",,"Absolutely nothing bad to say about the i5-12500! It bridges the gap between features and performance of Intel's higher end CPU's, which run hot and are prohibitively expensive, and budget entries that are likely to become outdated in just a few years. Very happy with the overall performance of this unit, especially alongside an Nvidia 3080ti GPU for gaming, streaming, encoding, and video editing! Runs cool and fast with good benchmarks. Definitely an ideal choice for a budget-conscious, high-end DDR4 gaming system while waiting for DDR5 to hit better price-to-performance ratios. Highly recommended!"
De momento va todo bien,,Recomendado al 100%
i5 12th gen made a huge difference in my gaming frames,,"Seeing how video cards that are 3xxx series are selling for triple list price, I don't want to spend $1K on a video card when I have a GTX 1660, now that I have the i5-12500 my frame rates have gone up significantly in Valerant and other games I play. I went from 65 frames to 300 frames. I am very happy with the 12th gen I5."
Automatically Overclocks,,"I run this in a ripping/BOINC 130+% CPU environment. It is automatically running constantly overclocked at 4+GHz on my Asus MB and my Mugen 5 revC cooler is readily taking care of what heat it is producing, keeping it well under 60DegC. There is still CPU headroom for my non-constant desktop needs, with instant response."
Top notch seller.,,"Intel 12500.
Nice cool running processor.Shocked how well UHD Graphics 770 works for light gaming.

Seller was great.Amazon packaging is off on boxed processors.Shipped in “bag” not box.Prone to shipping damage."
Intel I5-12500 with UHD 770,,Very good for HTPC. With two media engines for AV1 hardware decode.
Dishonest seller,,"I purchased this product from ""Computer Upgrade King"", and it was described as being the retail model of the processor with the stock heat sink. Instead it came with a crappy oversized ""gaming"" heatsink and wrapped in cardboard rather than anti-static packaging. I've had to return it, as this oversized heatsink and fan will not fit in my NAS. Do not buy anything from ""Computer Upgrade King""."
Good CPU for Price,,Price was fair and performs as expected. iGPU is great for media transcoding.
Great CPU,,"I love this CPU, it chunks though decent workloads without issue. I am rather impressed with the video capabilities of this processor, it does a great job for being on-board graphics. I would not recommend it for a gamer as being a replacement for a GPU, but it does run AOE IV fine. I have this for my 3d Rendering / Slicing workstation and it does the job great, I have the i7-12700F in my 3d printer as its a headless configuration, i didn't need the graphics at the time."
Great CPU,,"Not 2.1ghz, just at resting speed"
"I don't need no 13th, or 14th Gen!",,Best 'bang for the bucks' Intel CPU on the market today. Get One!
Great CPU,,"I'm using the stock Intel cooler that came with my 12700 and the highest I hit in games is about 79c, most of the time is stays in the low 70s. Idle temps stay in the 30s. That's with the cpu wattage unlocked and raising the pl1 and pl2 settings a bit in the bios and a single intake and single exhaust fan in a mid size case. I learned a long time ago that ambient room temp and fan curves are very important. You want to exhaust as much hot air as you can out of the case as fast as possible. You can mount a skyscraper to your CPU and have 12 case fans, if your room temp is high and you don't set proper fan curves, you'll still run hot. I don't care about cinebench or other benchmarks, most games people play and apps people use on a daily basis will never stress the CPU anywhere near what a benchmark will. If you do a lot of heavy video editing and conversion work and raise your wattage limits way up then yes go for a higher end cooling solution .

Edit: I've since installed an Intel RH1 cooler (the one that comes with the i9) on this chip and it dropped my temps by an average of about 8c. I know I can buy a third party cooler but I don't want a huge cpu cooler in my case and I don't want to play with brackets that may not fit 100% correctly. You can find new RH1 coolers on ebay for pretty cheap."
VMWare ESXi and E-Cores,,"As a desktop processor for Windows, the CPU is great. My use case is as a consumer-grade ESXi server (specifically the latest version, 8). As I feared, ESXi cannot be installed with the stupid E-cores. So, one must disable them in BIOS and all is good. So essentially it's used as an eight P-core processor only.

ESXi is designed for server-grade hardware, which doesn't have the silly E-cores. Perhaps one day VMWare will be able to at least detect E-cores processors and not use them (or treat them differently).

My motherboard is an ASUS ROG Strix B760-I along with Corsair 2x48GB DDR5 RAM (CMK96GX5M2B6400C32, 96GB total) and a 4TB M.2 drive."
Exceptional Business Performance,,I built 7 desktop business computers with this processor. Great performance. Office programs open almost instantaneously. QuickBooks opening much faster. Network accessibility improved. Low fan noise and temperature. We are very happy with this Intel processor. Computer companies are pushing the 10th and 11th generation to reduce their inventory. Building the computers ourselves let us be on the latest and best performing 12th generation.
ABSOLUTO ❤️,,"La verdad NO tenía altas espectativas debido a que la frecuencia base me parecía muy baja (@2.1 ghz), sin embargo haciendo algunos test de rendimiento, rapidamente los nucleos subian a 4.3 ghz sin mucho esfuerzo aparente. Los resultados de los benchmark fueron muy altos y la temperatura muy bien gestionada. Estoy contento con este i7 12700... Trabajo con Edición de video profesional
.
The truth is I did NOT have high expectations because the base frequency seemed very low (@2.1 ghz), however doing some performance tests, the cores quickly went up to 4.3 ghz without much apparent effort, the benchmark results were very high and temperature very well managed. I am happy with this i7 12700"
Intel i7-12700 fast with onboard graphics,,Fast and the graphics are serviceable. Only downside is you can't overclock it. I ended up getting a separate graphics card anyway so I should have gotten the 12700k or kf so I could overclock. Still very fast for anything I want to do.
I got a used one and it works great!,,"I love this thing, it's such an upgrade from what I had before. I used to have an i5-6700k, I paired this with a B660 MAG Tomahawk Wifi DDR4 and 64gb of ram and now things are niiice."
Intel is the Best for Processors,,This processor is a great deal for the money.
doing it's job.,,"no issues with the product, although i did get shipped the wrong product at first. everyone please double-check what comes in the mail."
Great for content creators / productivity geared PCs,,Runs fast with adequate cooling and the integrated graphics is perfect for Photoshop and editing with Premiere. The quick sync feature makes this chip well worth it!
Definitely rocket speed,,"Coming from my 3rd gen intel i5 chip, this thing is very fast. Runs cools with aftermarket cooler, easy installation."
"easy install, no hassle.",,this cpu chip works very well. The install process was very easy and stress free.
Overheats and crashes,,"I'm really disappointed in this CPU. I thought I was upgrading to a more powerful computer but this chip in a new ASUS Prime board heats up with ordinary loads and crashes my Lenux OS computer. It does not even do as well as the CPU and board it replaced even though it was supposed to be much better. Too bad. I've returned the board for a refund and if this CPU goes back, too, if it does not perform better in a different mobo."
$500 of electronics and No in the box packing.,,"Ordered a i7-12700 for $350 and $130 32G DDR5 memory and they arrived in a box together with NO PACKING MATERIAL at all, no bubble wrap, no paper, just randomly bouncing around in a medium size box together. When the rest of the components get here, if it does not work, I know what to send back."
Good for the price,,"Good with ASUS TUF B660, benchmark 33000"
I got an USED item,,"This is an USED item. Lucky my son checked it out, he said it was very dirty. The attached photo shows the CPU has some grey residue which I suspect is thermal paste from last use. Besides, the box was beaten up and no instructions found inside the box."
dollar per threads,,"Nice package, easy to install and best price for performance."
This is the best you'll get in this price range Thats it!,,"If you would be building pc just for gaming and slight editing or coding here and there this is perfect and the cost is really low considering what performance it gives, this CPU is by no means a low end CPU dont go gentle with that price the intel 12100f can easily handle GPUs upto gtx3060 or rx6800. Just go for it and say no to ryzen in this price for gaming."
Awesome,,"This is one of the best cpu in budget if you only looking for gaming.
For productivity it not worth buying then you should go for i5 12400f
But for gaming and light cpu workload it work like butter smooth.
I have teated some games in it , you can check it on my YT channel R tech studio."
Best in price when even compared to i5 10400f,,Got this on sale for 7.26k.. Really enjoyed with processor. Heatsink fan provided looks good but sounds badly at peak usage. Replaced it with air cooler
Good,,Performance is good
Used or Unboxed product received,,"Product is good but by looking at packaging anyone can judge that it is used. While checking warranty found that out of 3 year warranty, 6 months is already passed."
cpu with broken fan,,Cpu stock cooler fan got broken with 1 blade in box was creating noise and virbration in cpu but processor was working fine so thought to replace but if replace it i dont know what i am gonna get with broken cpu chip so i replaced stock cooler with deepcool air cooler now it's working fine please don't buy critical pc parts from Amazon you may end up getting with broken parts worst packing
Good Cpu but awful Delivery,,"The Processor is Good & Works Fine. But The Delivery was awful, one of the blades of the fan was broken. As i already had another dedicated cpu cooler, i didn't raise a return. I expected Better from Appario. Apart From this the Processor itself works fine."
Perfeito,,"Muito bom, super recomendo"

Não é uma maquina top mas resolve muuuiiito. Excetuando-se situações específicas de uso gráfico pesado excelente opção.
Best budget performer ever !,,"I've had many different processors in the past. I find this 10100 one in particular, to give me the biggest bang for my buck! You have to spend quite a bit more to get more performance, and even then you'd only get like 15 to 25% more. The performance per CPU of this beauty is fantastic, plus you get more than ample performance when running many threads."

"Great Budget CPU, Not Overclockable - Comes with Cooler",,"DISCLAIMER: This review covers 3 main items (CPU, MOBO, RAM). Links to the other parts are included (all available at Amazon for good prices). You'll read this review on each of the other parts as well.

WHY DID I BUY IT?
I recently built and absolute beast of a computer and kept my older one as a backup. Unfortunately, it decided to take a dive this past week with the motherboard failing catastropically. Given that it was 10 years old, I decided to replace the ""brains"" with something a little more modern, but not overkill. Because I had spent a LOT of money on a computer recently, I was trying to keep the repair under about $400 and here's what I did...

The BRAINS...
Intel i3-10100 Processor ($100): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086MMRW87
MSI Mag B460 Motherboard ($110): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GXVP1DM
TeamGroup 16GB DDR4 ($60): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WNQVBZ6
*** These are the main parts that MUST be compatible.. and they are ***

I was worried about my hard drive, so I went ahead and splurged on a TeamGroup 1TB SSD ($75 -- www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PX2KKHM) bringing my total to just under $400. I could have kept my old Seagate 500gb 5400 RPM drive but I had a little extra to spend and that greatly sped up boot and wait times.

For what it's worth, I also kept my existing Antec Power Supply (550W) that was replaced about a year ago, my case, and my now very old graphics card (R9 380 - 4gb). I already had a good monitor, mouse, and keyboard so those carried over as well.

So how did it go together? Pretty seamlessly with just 2 little hiccups.

HICCUP #1
RAM: I did not realize the motherboard I purchased has a standard RAM speed of 2666. It can get up to a max of 2933. So the RAM I purchased (3200 speed, CL 16) is overkill and I could have saved another $20 or so. But, I didn't... and it's my first build with TeamGroup RAM and I'm happy with it.

HICCUP #2
LAN/AUDIO: Once I got everything installed, the LAN would not connect to my network (wired, ethernet connection). A little troubleshooting found out YOU MUST TO UPGRADE THE LAN DRIVER for it to work. This means having another computer with internet and a flash drive. Likewise, I went ahead and updated the Audio driver and the sound was much crisper. So... take a moment and download all of the drivers in advance from the MSI website.

FIRST POWER ON: The computer started up, then turned off immediately. It then restarted on it's own and said the motherboard had detected changes so I needed to configure the BIOS. Entering BIOS found that everything was recognized. So I changed the first boot device to USB flash drive and plugged in my Windows 10 install flash drive and restarted.

Bottom Line: The Intel i3-10100 is a great little chip (not overclockable). The MSI 460 Torpedo is a decent motherboard (just update the LAN and Audio drivers) that boots quickly. In fact, it boots so quickly, I don't even see the POST screen. From cold to Windows is easily under 30 seconds.

The RAM is stable at 2666 and fast enough that I probably won't even push the 2933 setting. The SSD is very fast (functionally almost as fast as the M2 drive I have in my beast at a savings of $20-25). Even with the aging R9 graphics card, I'm easily hitting 60 FPS on modern titles at 1080 in medium to high settings. Sometime next year when graphics card prices drop to a reasonable level, I'll update that and have a second gaming rig ready.

Overall, I'm very happy with this setup."
Che bomba!,,"Pagato 125 euro. Una bomba! Entry level quad core, nuovo chispet lga 1200. Intel, con questa gamma, ha fatto un bel salto avanti e nel mercato entry level si è piazzata decisamente davanti ai cari vecchi ryzen. Ho costruito una build per uso domestico/piccolo ufficio con poche centinaia di euro, ed il risultato è stato più che ottimo!
Ricordo che per chi è alla ricerca di una build decente (NON votata al gaming) questa è un'ottima scelta, considerando anche la grafica integrata che fa risparmiare sulla scheda video. E per chi volesse proprio concedersi un pò di momento ludico, qui fortnite e titoli simili non faticano.
L'unica pecca (ma il periodo è quello che è) è che si trovano poche schede madri lga 1200 ad un prezzo consono."

Inbuild with graphics,,"Great work with gigabyte h460m motherboard with corsair 8gb ram...
Still powerful performance also graphics is also good.."
box was already open,,Processor box was already open. But thank God processor was damaged.
Divisor de águas! Excelente custo benefício!,,Equivalente ao i7 da sétima geração e ao i5 da nona geração. Excelente custo benefício. A placa de vídeo onboard segura a maioria dos jogos em resolução baixa. controlador para até DDR4 2666. Se deseja DDr4 3200 melhor ir para a 11geração ou acima. Suporta bem uma GTX 1660 super. Não é uma maquina top mas resolve muuuiiito. Excetuando-se situações específicas de uso gráfico pesado excelente opção.
Best budget performer ever !,,"I've had many different processors in the past. I find this 10100 one in particular, to give me the biggest bang for my buck! You have to spend quite a bit more to get more performance, and even then you'd only get like 15 to 25% more. The performance per CPU of this beauty is fantastic, plus you get more than ample performance when running many threads."
Excelente procesador para gaming,,"Yo tengo pc gaming, vengo de un procesador feo Pentium 4600, que corria los juegos, pero hasta ahi, es todo lo que hacia, no podia hacer nada mas que jugar y ya, no podria hacer streaming, no podia entrar a discord para platicar o estar en comunicacion, nada, tenia que hacer una cosa a la vez, me compre este procesador.. y literal, el inicio cambio de 25 segundos a 6.5 segundos (siiii, es mucha diferencia) y ahora puedo hacer streaming y estar en discord mientras juego sin problemas ni nada, super potente para ser un i3 y corre los juegos en 60fps sin problemas a full hd (tengo una nvidia 1050ti)"

WHY DID I BUY IT?
I recently built and absolute beast of a computer and kept my older one as a backup. Unfortunately, it decided to take a dive this past week with the motherboard failing catastropically. Given that it was 10 years old, I decided to replace the ""brains"" with something a little more modern, but not overkill. Because I had spent a LOT of money on a computer recently, I was trying to keep the repair under about $400 and here's what I did...

The BRAINS...
Intel i3-10100 Processor ($100): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086MMRW87
MSI Mag B460 Motherboard ($110): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GXVP1DM
TeamGroup 16GB DDR4 ($60): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WNQVBZ6
*** These are the main parts that MUST be compatible.. and they are ***

I was worried about my hard drive, so I went ahead and splurged on a TeamGroup 1TB SSD ($75 -- www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PX2KKHM) bringing my total to just under $400. I could have kept my old Seagate 500gb 5400 RPM drive but I had a little extra to spend and that greatly sped up boot and wait times.

For what it's worth, I also kept my existing Antec Power Supply (550W) that was replaced about a year ago, my case, and my now very old graphics card (R9 380 - 4gb). I already had a good monitor, mouse, and keyboard so those carried over as well.

So how did it go together? Pretty seamlessly with just 2 little hiccups.

HICCUP #1
RAM: I did not realize the motherboard I purchased has a standard RAM speed of 2666. It can get up to a max of 2933. So the RAM I purchased (3200 speed, CL 16) is overkill and I could have saved another $20 or so. But, I didn't... and it's my first build with TeamGroup RAM and I'm happy with it.

HICCUP #2
LAN/AUDIO: Once I got everything installed, the LAN would not connect to my network (wired, ethernet connection). A little troubleshooting found out YOU MUST TO UPGRADE THE LAN DRIVER for it to work. This means having another computer with internet and a flash drive. Likewise, I went ahead and updated the Audio driver and the sound was much crisper. So... take a moment and download all of the drivers in advance from the MSI website.

FIRST POWER ON: The computer started up, then turned off immediately. It then restarted on it's own and said the motherboard had detected changes so I needed to configure the BIOS. Entering BIOS found that everything was recognized. So I changed the first boot device to USB flash drive and plugged in my Windows 10 install flash drive and restarted.

Bottom Line: The Intel i3-10100 is a great little chip (not overclockable). The MSI 460 Torpedo is a decent motherboard (just update the LAN and Audio drivers) that boots quickly. In fact, it boots so quickly, I don't even see the POST screen. From cold to Windows is easily under 30 seconds.

The RAM is stable at 2666 and fast enough that I probably won't even push the 2933 setting. The SSD is very fast (functionally almost as fast as the M2 drive I have in my beast at a savings of $20-25). Even with the aging R9 graphics card, I'm easily hitting 60 FPS on modern titles at 1080 in medium to high settings. Sometime next year when graphics card prices drop to a reasonable level, I'll update that and have a second gaming rig ready.

Overall, I'm very happy with this setup."
Che bomba!,,"Pagato 125 euro. Una bomba! Entry level quad core, nuovo chispet lga 1200. Intel, con questa gamma, ha fatto un bel salto avanti e nel mercato entry level si è piazzata decisamente davanti ai cari vecchi ryzen. Ho costruito una build per uso domestico/piccolo ufficio con poche centinaia di euro, ed il risultato è stato più che ottimo!
Ricordo che per chi è alla ricerca di una build decente (NON votata al gaming) questa è un'ottima scelta, considerando anche la grafica integrata che fa risparmiare sulla scheda video. E per chi volesse proprio concedersi un pò di momento ludico, qui fortnite e titoli simili non faticano.
L'unica pecca (ma il periodo è quello che è) è che si trovano poche schede madri lga 1200 ad un prezzo consono."
Overkill for me and Most.,,"This started a new PC build for me when it was on sale for $320. I haven't built a PC since 2007, so it has changed a bit since then. This thing runs hot at full load. Watch gamers nexus on YouTube. It will pull a solid 250+ watts running cinebench. I'm using an Arctic Freezer 2 420mm with a thermal grizzly contact frame and kryonaut, and it will load up to 80 degrees almost instantly without throttling but drop immediately to 25-30 degrees when the load stops. This is with ambient at 22 degrees.

This thing is brutally fast, though, and in reality, outside of load testing it, I have rarely seen it go over 30% usage. The more recent i5 and i7 processors can more or less be equal in most use cases. i5 13/14600, i7 13/14700.

This processor is still top-tier and will be for a few years to come. 12th gen i-series processors were a game-changer, the 13th-gen improved on them a bit with more e-cores, and the 14th-gen is looking like a stop-gap to the next big thing.

You won't be disappointed; make sure to keep it cool."
"The old king, still capible",,"Cannot complain for its price, almost good as an i7 13700K."
Chegou rápido,,O produto chegou rápido e bem embalado dentro de uma caixa Amazon. Isso demonstra o cuidado com um produto caríssimo e frágil. Ainda não instalei nem abri o box mas acredito que esteja ok. Se houver alguma surpresa volto aqui para avisar.
Sello de caja roto,,"La caja venía con el sello roto, sin embargo, el procesador esta en buen estado y funcionando."
