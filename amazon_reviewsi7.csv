Good CPU for Price,,Price was fair and performs as expected. iGPU is great for media transcoding.
Great CPU,,"I love this CPU, it chunks though decent workloads without issue. I am rather impressed with the video capabilities of this processor, it does a great job for being on-board graphics. I would not recommend it for a gamer as being a replacement for a GPU, but it does run AOE IV fine. I have this for my 3d Rendering / Slicing workstation and it does the job great, I have the i7-12700F in my 3d printer as its a headless configuration, i didn't need the graphics at the time."
Great CPU,,"Not 2.1ghz, just at resting speed"
"I don't need no 13th, or 14th Gen!",,Best 'bang for the bucks' Intel CPU on the market today. Get One!
Great CPU,,"I'm using the stock Intel cooler that came with my 12700 and the highest I hit in games is about 79c, most of the time is stays in the low 70s. Idle temps stay in the 30s. That's with the cpu wattage unlocked and raising the pl1 and pl2 settings a bit in the bios and a single intake and single exhaust fan in a mid size case. I learned a long time ago that ambient room temp and fan curves are very important. You want to exhaust as much hot air as you can out of the case as fast as possible. You can mount a skyscraper to your CPU and have 12 case fans, if your room temp is high and you don't set proper fan curves, you'll still run hot. I don't care about cinebench or other benchmarks, most games people play and apps people use on a daily basis will never stress the CPU anywhere near what a benchmark will. If you do a lot of heavy video editing and conversion work and raise your wattage limits way up then yes go for a higher end cooling solution .

Edit: I've since installed an Intel RH1 cooler (the one that comes with the i9) on this chip and it dropped my temps by an average of about 8c. I know I can buy a third party cooler but I don't want a huge cpu cooler in my case and I don't want to play with brackets that may not fit 100% correctly. You can find new RH1 coolers on ebay for pretty cheap."
VMWare ESXi and E-Cores,,"As a desktop processor for Windows, the CPU is great. My use case is as a consumer-grade ESXi server (specifically the latest version, 8). As I feared, ESXi cannot be installed with the stupid E-cores. So, one must disable them in BIOS and all is good. So essentially it's used as an eight P-core processor only.

ESXi is designed for server-grade hardware, which doesn't have the silly E-cores. Perhaps one day VMWare will be able to at least detect E-cores processors and not use them (or treat them differently).

My motherboard is an ASUS ROG Strix B760-I along with Corsair 2x48GB DDR5 RAM (CMK96GX5M2B6400C32, 96GB total) and a 4TB M.2 drive."
Exceptional Business Performance,,I built 7 desktop business computers with this processor. Great performance. Office programs open almost instantaneously. QuickBooks opening much faster. Network accessibility improved. Low fan noise and temperature. We are very happy with this Intel processor. Computer companies are pushing the 10th and 11th generation to reduce their inventory. Building the computers ourselves let us be on the latest and best performing 12th generation.
ABSOLUTO ❤️,,"La verdad NO tenía altas espectativas debido a que la frecuencia base me parecía muy baja (@2.1 ghz), sin embargo haciendo algunos test de rendimiento, rapidamente los nucleos subian a 4.3 ghz sin mucho esfuerzo aparente. Los resultados de los benchmark fueron muy altos y la temperatura muy bien gestionada. Estoy contento con este i7 12700... Trabajo con Edición de video profesional
.
The truth is I did NOT have high expectations because the base frequency seemed very low (@2.1 ghz), however doing some performance tests, the cores quickly went up to 4.3 ghz without much apparent effort, the benchmark results were very high and temperature very well managed. I am happy with this i7 12700"
Intel i7-12700 fast with onboard graphics,,Fast and the graphics are serviceable. Only downside is you can't overclock it. I ended up getting a separate graphics card anyway so I should have gotten the 12700k or kf so I could overclock. Still very fast for anything I want to do.
I got a used one and it works great!,,"I love this thing, it's such an upgrade from what I had before. I used to have an i5-6700k, I paired this with a B660 MAG Tomahawk Wifi DDR4 and 64gb of ram and now things are niiice."
Intel is the Best for Processors,,This processor is a great deal for the money.
doing it's job.,,"no issues with the product, although i did get shipped the wrong product at first. everyone please double-check what comes in the mail."
Great for content creators / productivity geared PCs,,Runs fast with adequate cooling and the integrated graphics is perfect for Photoshop and editing with Premiere. The quick sync feature makes this chip well worth it!
Definitely rocket speed,,"Coming from my 3rd gen intel i5 chip, this thing is very fast. Runs cools with aftermarket cooler, easy installation."
"easy install, no hassle.",,this cpu chip works very well. The install process was very easy and stress free.
Overheats and crashes,,"I'm really disappointed in this CPU. I thought I was upgrading to a more powerful computer but this chip in a new ASUS Prime board heats up with ordinary loads and crashes my Lenux OS computer. It does not even do as well as the CPU and board it replaced even though it was supposed to be much better. Too bad. I've returned the board for a refund and if this CPU goes back, too, if it does not perform better in a different mobo."
$500 of electronics and No in the box packing.,,"Ordered a i7-12700 for $350 and $130 32G DDR5 memory and they arrived in a box together with NO PACKING MATERIAL at all, no bubble wrap, no paper, just randomly bouncing around in a medium size box together. When the rest of the components get here, if it does not work, I know what to send back."
Good for the price,,"Good with ASUS TUF B660, benchmark 33000"
I got an USED item,,"This is an USED item. Lucky my son checked it out, he said it was very dirty. The attached photo shows the CPU has some grey residue which I suspect is thermal paste from last use. Besides, the box was beaten up and no instructions found inside the box."
dollar per threads,,"Nice package, easy to install and best price for performance."
