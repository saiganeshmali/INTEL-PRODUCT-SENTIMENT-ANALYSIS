Overkill for me and Most.,,"This started a new PC build for me when it was on sale for $320. I haven't built a PC since 2007, so it has changed a bit since then. This thing runs hot at full load. Watch gamers nexus on YouTube. It will pull a solid 250+ watts running cinebench. I'm using an Arctic Freezer 2 420mm with a thermal grizzly contact frame and kryonaut, and it will load up to 80 degrees almost instantly without throttling but drop immediately to 25-30 degrees when the load stops. This is with ambient at 22 degrees.

This thing is brutally fast, though, and in reality, outside of load testing it, I have rarely seen it go over 30% usage. The more recent i5 and i7 processors can more or less be equal in most use cases. i5 13/14600, i7 13/14700.

This processor is still top-tier and will be for a few years to come. 12th gen i-series processors were a game-changer, the 13th-gen improved on them a bit with more e-cores, and the 14th-gen is looking like a stop-gap to the next big thing.

You won't be disappointed; make sure to keep it cool."
"The old king, still capible",,"Cannot complain for its price, almost good as an i7 13700K."
Chegou rápido,,O produto chegou rápido e bem embalado dentro de uma caixa Amazon. Isso demonstra o cuidado com um produto caríssimo e frágil. Ainda não instalei nem abri o box mas acredito que esteja ok. Se houver alguma surpresa volto aqui para avisar.
Sello de caja roto,,"La caja venía con el sello roto, sin embargo, el procesador esta en buen estado y funcionando."
かなり爆速です。,,以前使用していた１０世代i9より早いです。　早速ＤＤＲ５　１２８MBにして、稼働させています。
