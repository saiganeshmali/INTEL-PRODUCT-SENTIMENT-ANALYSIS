"The True ""Sweet Spot"" in 12th Gen Processors!",,"Absolutely nothing bad to say about the i5-12500! It bridges the gap between features and performance of Intel's higher end CPU's, which run hot and are prohibitively expensive, and budget entries that are likely to become outdated in just a few years. Very happy with the overall performance of this unit, especially alongside an Nvidia 3080ti GPU for gaming, streaming, encoding, and video editing! Runs cool and fast with good benchmarks. Definitely an ideal choice for a budget-conscious, high-end DDR4 gaming system while waiting for DDR5 to hit better price-to-performance ratios. Highly recommended!"
De momento va todo bien,,Recomendado al 100%
i5 12th gen made a huge difference in my gaming frames,,"Seeing how video cards that are 3xxx series are selling for triple list price, I don't want to spend $1K on a video card when I have a GTX 1660, now that I have the i5-12500 my frame rates have gone up significantly in Valerant and other games I play. I went from 65 frames to 300 frames. I am very happy with the 12th gen I5."
Automatically Overclocks,,"I run this in a ripping/BOINC 130+% CPU environment. It is automatically running constantly overclocked at 4+GHz on my Asus MB and my Mugen 5 revC cooler is readily taking care of what heat it is producing, keeping it well under 60DegC. There is still CPU headroom for my non-constant desktop needs, with instant response."
Top notch seller.,,"Intel 12500.
Nice cool running processor.Shocked how well UHD Graphics 770 works for light gaming.

Seller was great.Amazon packaging is off on boxed processors.Shipped in “bag” not box.Prone to shipping damage."
Intel I5-12500 with UHD 770,,Very good for HTPC. With two media engines for AV1 hardware decode.
Dishonest seller,,"I purchased this product from ""Computer Upgrade King"", and it was described as being the retail model of the processor with the stock heat sink. Instead it came with a crappy oversized ""gaming"" heatsink and wrapped in cardboard rather than anti-static packaging. I've had to return it, as this oversized heatsink and fan will not fit in my NAS. Do not buy anything from ""Computer Upgrade King""."
